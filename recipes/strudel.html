        <h2>How to make an Apple strudel</h2>
        <h4>Here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade apple strudel:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir the apples, brown sugar, golden raisins, and flour in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Place each puff pastry on a lightly floured work surface and roll into two rectangles.</li>
            <li>Fill and seal each pastry, then transfer to a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Brush on the egg wash and cut slits into the top.</li>
            <li>Bake until golden brown.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium Granny Smith apple - peeled, cored and coarsely shredded</li>

            <li>Working with one sheet at a time, place puff pastry on a lightly floured work surface. Roll lightly with a rolling pin into an approximately 10- x 12-inch rectangle. Arrange 1/2 of the apple filling (about 3 cups) down one side of pastry lengthwise.</li>
            <li>Fold pastry lengthwise over apple mixture; dampen edges of pastry with water, then press or crimp edges to seal. Repeat process with 2nd pastry sheet and remaining apple mixture.</li>
            <li>Transfer to prepared baking sheet, leaving at least 2-inches between each pastry. Whisk egg and milk together in a small bowl; brush on top of each pastry. Cut 3 or 4 slits on top of each pastry to allow steam to escape.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
            <li>Slice, serve, and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
